<p margin: center;><em>Welcome to my introductions page! The purpose of this page is to show you information about me!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Background: </b>My name is Will and I was born and raised here in NC. I am and always have been an avid gamer and I leaned towards working with computers and technology as my career, though I also enjoy a lot of trades as well.</li>
<li><b>Professional Background: </b>I worked in welding at CDI for a little under a year, but other than that I haven't had a whole lot of professional work experience.</li>
<li><b>Academic Background: </b>I have jumped all over the place with regards to my academics. I started out going to UNC Charlotte for computer science for 2 years and then I decided that maybe a trade would be a better fit for me so I went to CPCC for the welding program for a few semesters and now I currently have decided that maybe computers would be best and here I am again.</li>
<li><b>Primary Computer Platform: </b>I primarily use a Windows operating system on an Omen laptop which is some new laptop brand.</li>
<li><b>Courses I'm taking and why:</b>
<ul>
