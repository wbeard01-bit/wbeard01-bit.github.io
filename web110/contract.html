	<h1>William Beard - Web-110-85 - Course Contract</h1>
	<p>I, William agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2020 WEB110-85 Internet/Web Fundamentals with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
	<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
	<p>Signed: William Collin Beard, 8/18/20</p>
	<h2>Workspace Setup</h2>
	<p>Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and cropped and sized the image appropriately. Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder.</p>
